1.Why Map-reduce program is needed in Pig Programming?
A. When we want to develop UDFs, MAP-REDUCE program (or) MAP-REDUCE knowledge is required
   Ultimately, all Pig scripts will be converted to MAP-REDUCE jobs anyway

2.What are the advantages of pig over MapReduce?
A. Development easeness
   Less effort

3.What is pig engine and what is its importance?
A. Pig engine consists of Parser,Optimizer,Compiler and Execution engine
   All the above components are responsible for converting PIG scriprs into DAG and then into MAP-REDUCE jobs


4.What are the modes of Pig execution?
A. Local mode
   Map-Reduce mode
   tez_local
   tez mode

5.What is grunt shell in pig?
A. It is a runner of the Pig commands 
   We can even execute normal shell commands by suffixing sh

6.What are the features of Pig Latin language?
A. Many built-in functions 
   scripting 

7.Is Pig Lating commands case sensitive?
A. No
   Only functions and relations are case sensitive

8.What is a data flow language?
A. In Pig, Data will not be loaded until it encounters LOAD or STORE functions
   Then Pig transforms the Data by executing the commands we provided
   In this whole process, Data transformation is done, i.e. DATA FLOW LANGUAGE
